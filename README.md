# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

  // important status code

// 2xx: Success
// 200 OK: The request succeeded (e.g., data fetched successfully).
// 201 Created: Used when a resource is successfully created (e.g., a new product or user).
// 204 No Content: The request succeeded but there is no content to send in the response (e.g., after a successful delete operation).
// 3xx: Redirection
// Rarely used in API-based MERN apps. You may encounter:
// 301 Moved Permanently: If a resource URL changes.
// 307 Temporary Redirect: If a resource is temporarily located elsewhere.
// 4xx: Client Errors
// 400 Bad Request: The request is invalid (e.g., missing required fields in the request body).
// 401 Unauthorized: Authentication is required or invalid (e.g., token missing or expired).
// 403 Forbidden: The client does not have permission to access the resource (e.g., trying to delete someone else's data).
// 404 Not Found: The requested resource does not exist (e.g., invalid product ID).
// 422 Unprocessable Entity: Validation error on input data.
// 5xx: Server Errors
// 500 Internal Server Error: A generic error indicating something went wrong on the server.
// 503 Service Unavailable: The server is temporarily unable to handle the request (e.g., maintenance mode).
